# Anecdotes

_My solution to the **anecdotes** exercises in part1 of **FullStackOpen 2020** web development course._

**Anecdotes** is a React app that displays random anecdotes. It also offers a voting feature which can display the the number of upvotes for anecdote as well as display the most voted anecdote.

This project is built with React using Create-React-App.
